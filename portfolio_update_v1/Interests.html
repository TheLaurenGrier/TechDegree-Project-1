      <p>This is a picture I took of my motorcycle. I was always afraid to try it out, but when I started building websites, I was able to get over fears and buy my first bike!</p>
      <p> I broke my arm while kickboxing and I wasn't allowed to drive or use my stationary bike. After healing from that injury, I ditched the stationary bike, and conquered my fears. Mom, I wear a helmet (I promise!)</p>

      <h2>Jiu Jitsu</h2>

      <p>Jiu Jitsu has helped me so much in ever aspect of my life. It keeps me disciplined and focused. You have to know how to problem solve and react quickly, and you there is so much to learn, you have to humble yourself. I have so much respect for my team, and I am always honored to share the mat with them.</p>
      
      <p>Always try to leave at least 1% better.</p>
